Short Bio
===================================================

This is a brief summary of my journey so far as a researcher/developer:

- _circa 1983_. Discovered computers at age 5-7. Started reading every manual or magazine I could get my hands on about games, BASIC, assembly, ... I had occasional access to an MSX micro-computer I could practice with.

- _circa 1987_. After insisting for years, I miraculously got my own first computer: a Philips NMS 9100 (Intel 8088).

- My life was taken over by GW-BASIC, Turbo Pascal, and x86 assembly. Then I jumped over to C and C++, which are still my weapons of choice.

- _1995_. Studied Computer Engineering (a 6-year degree). Meanwhile I worked as a programmer in the medical visualization field so I could afford my tuition. Every spare minute was otherwise spent on a myriad of personal coding projects; mostly custom game engines and such.

- _2001_. Started my PhD in applied math.

- _2001_. I co-founded Feversoft SL (my first company). We offered real-time architectural visualization services using bespoke tech. We experimented a lot with stereoscopic displays, tactile surfaces, ...

- _2004_. I created fryrender to address the light-baking needs we had in some of those projects. Eventually, fryrender became one of the very first physically-based render engines in the world.

- _2006_. First public release of fryrender as a stand-alone product.

- _2008_. I founded [RandomControl SLU](https://randomcontrol.com/) to focus exclusively on fryrender and further rendering endeavours.

- _2011_. Arion was released, superseding fryrender. Arion was one of the very first GPU-accelerated render engines.

- _2014_. [ArionFX](http://arionfx.com/) was released.

- _2017_. Development of [Maverick Render](https://maverickrender.com/) started.

- _2019_. First public releases of Maverick Studio and Maverick Indie.

- _2023_. First public release of [Maverick Excelsior](https://maverickexcelsior.com/).
